# Selenium Version of Auto View Bot

**This is the source code for the fireliker tool automation.**

**Nyumat: I tried to keep this documentation as non-programmer legible as possible for some of you that aren't fluent coders yet.**

What this code does is takes your Tik Tok username and goes onto a Web App which can give you up to 1000 views per 5 minutes.

>Don't worry, we're working on better and faster ways to get views. 

While yes, this isn't the infamous share bot that once was, it is key into making progress to where we once were.

### To run the code..

**Keep in Mind! You will need Python 3.7 or higher to complie this.**

First think you need to do is setup a virtual enviornment.
```
 mkdir (project-name)
 cd (project-name)
 virtualenv --python=python(version) venv
```  
  Now that you set up a place to store the code,  you must do this anytime you want to activate the virtual environment, which is done like this:
```
 cd (project-name)
 source venv/bin/activate
```
Download the needed libraries:
```
 pip install selenium
 pip install time
```
**Once you have the libraries, you're good to go!**

Now all you have to do is use your IDE of choice, download autoViews.py and click run.
